# Summary 

Well done! You made it to the end of the workshop successfully, generating text copy, images, and exploring multi-modal capabilities leveraging the power of generative AI.

## Some key points to remember
- Generative AI models can generate human-like text, images, and code
- Generative AI models are stateless: they do not learn, and are constrained by their training data which is frozen at a fixed point in time
- Azure OpenAI Service is a managed service that provides access to state-of-the-art natural language generative AI models, including GPT-4, GPT-4 turbo and GPT-4o from OpenAI with the security and enterprise promise of Azure.
- Azure AI Studio is the unified hub to access all AI services in Azure, and it provides a seamless experience to interact with OpenAI models through the Playground.
- Prompt engineering is a technique for "grounding" generative AI models, and can be used to influence the style of a model's output, provide factual information, and constrain unintended behavior.
- Azure OpenAI Assistants are a new feature that makes it easier for developers to create applications with sophisticated copilot-like experiences that can sift through data, suggest solutions, and automate tasks by integrating tools.
