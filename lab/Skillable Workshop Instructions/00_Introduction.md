# Introduction

> [!NOTE]
>This is a **75-minute** workshop that will give you a hands-on introduction to the core concepts and best practices for interacting with OpenAI models.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

 - Describe OpenAI model capabilities and implementation in the field of text generation, image generation, multimodal conversation, function calling and Azure OpenAI Assistants.
 - Understand prompt engineering concepts and best practices.
 - Leverage generative AI capabilities and apply prompt engineering techniques to your own solutions.

## Lab Scenario

You are a developer at *Contoso Outdoor Company*, a leading e-commerce company that sells outdoor gear and equipment. Your team is working on a new website design and you have been tasked with generating text content, images, and code snippets for the website. You have heard about the power of generative AI models and want to explore how you can leverage them to generate content for the website.

## Lab Outline

The lab is organized into 5 sections, taking you through generating text content, image assets, and code snippets through a multimodal conversational interface on Azure with OpenAI models. In addition, we will cover Function Calling and AI Assistants. The goal of the lab is to leverage generative AI to build the user interface components for the *Contoso Outdoor Company* e-commerce website.

1. **Part 1 - Text Generation** Generate text content and descriptions with GPT4-Turbo
2. **Part 2 - Image Generation** Generate image assets with DALLE-3
3. **Part 3 - Multimodality** Leverage multimodal capabilities of GPT-4o to generate code snippets from hand-drawn sketches.
4. **Part 4 - Azure AI Assistants** Use code interpreter to understand your data.
5. **Part 5 - Function Calling** Generate structured outputs with GPT-4o.
