> [!NOTE]
> Azure AI Studio hosts some of the most popular foundation models provided by companies such as Microsoft, Open AI, Hugging Face, Meta and Mistral.

- **Playgrounds**: The Playgrounds represent a fast and accessible way to interact with the models.
- **Shared Resources**: This tab provides access to the resources connected or shared by the AI Hub. Here you can access resources such as the model Deployments, connections to other services, compute instances available in the Hub, user access and content filters applied to our models.

### Hub Overview

On this page, we can see an overview of our Azure AI Studio Hub. This includes the following:

- **Projects**: A project is a resource within Azure AI Studio that grants us access to most of the platform's features, such as the **Project Playgrounds**. You will notice we have a project created already. This is intentional and we will be working with it in the upcoming sections.
- **Description**: A short description of the Azure AI Studio Hub we are in.
- **Hub Properties**: A collection of various properties such as the Hub's name, its location, resource group, etc. Here we can find useful information such as *API endpoints and keys* and the *subscription's quota*.
- **Connected Resources**: Azure AI Studio allows for multiple resources to be connected to it, expanding its features and functionality. Resources such as Azure AI Search, or in our case, Azure AI Service further increase the capabilities of our Hub, and grant us access to deployments such as LLMs or functionalities such as vector search.
- **Users**: Allows us to grant access to collaborators or applications that may need to use the services within the Hub.

## Project Overview

1. Now, under the **Projects** section, locate the existing project. Click on this project to move forward and access the detailed project environment. 
 
 >[!alert] Click on the existing project to move forward.
 
 ![image showing where to click to access a project](./Images/ai-studio-click-project.jpg)

The Project overview page is very similar to the Hub Overview, except the details are tied to the project instead of the Hub that hosts it. 

### Navigation Bar

You will notice the navigation bar has updated with new tabs, which represent functionalities tied to our project. The **Get Started** section remains the same, and **Project Playgrounds** are expanded to include other versions.

We have two new sections:
- **Tools**: This includes useful opportunities to expand your project's reach, such as ***working in VS Code*** by running a cloud compute, access to [***Prompt Flow***](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/prompt-flow), development of ***Evaluations*** for your models and the ability to carry ***Fine Tuning*** on your deployments.
- **Components**: Here you can add complimentary elements to the project, with resources such as ***Data***, ***Indexes***, ***Deployments*** and ***Content Filters*** to be used as part of your work.

For this lab we will focus on using the **Playgrounds**. Click on the Chat Playground and move on to the next section.

## Project Playgrounds

You will notice we have four options for our **Project Playground**. Each option represents a different approach to interacting and using AI models, which can be tailored to our specific needs.

We will be carrying most of our work in these Playgrounds, but namely in the following three:

- **Chat Playground**
- **Images Playground**
- **Assistants Playground**
